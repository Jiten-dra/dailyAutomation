# Trigger Task on event
Why not scheduling because scheduling is to planning a task on given time but we do not always want to execute something based on time but event.
###### Few Usecases
- Show todo when I login to my device.
- Start selected set of application or open documents
- Pull all git repository(which I forget many times)
- save all documents on logout from system
- gradiently reducing bluelight ans start light music near sleep time
- pop up window to update time if you are doing time logging
